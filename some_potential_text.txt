Compounded year after year, this inequity becomes exorbitant."),

To put this into context, graduate student workers making $27K asking for a 100% raise seems unreasonable. Meanwhile, chancellors getting up to a 28% raise on $450k was approved earlier this year. At the end of the day, one of these people gets an extra $27k that goes towards cost of living while the other gets $120k that goes towards idk a yacht."),
