We tend to talk about raises in terms of percentages, but this is just one part of the full picture. The *absolute dollar amount* that we receive in a raise depends on this percentage *as well as our prior year's salary*. 
Our system of tying raises to a percentage of prior year income locks lower-paid positions out of real wage growth, exacerabating income disparities between higher-paid executives and lower-paid workers.
See how this disparity plays out in the UC system by comparing higher-paid employees to lower-paid employees in the following plot.

This system locks lower-paid positions out of real wage growth, puts workers at the mercy of unpredictable rises in cost of living, and exacerabates income disparities between high-income executives and low-income workers.
